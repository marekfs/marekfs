Thanks for checking out my personal site. I've built the website using Jekyll + Github Pages, and over the next few days I'll be tweaking the configuration and should have a meaningful first post soon!

Testing code snippits:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
