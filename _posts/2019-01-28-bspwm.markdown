Spent the last few hours playing with bspwm - a tilling window manager for linux. There are a lot of configurations, so it's taken me some time, but it's coming along.

I'll post some more photos with info about the tools I have installed along with a link to my .dotfiles repo once I'm done with my configuration (are you ever really *done*?).
