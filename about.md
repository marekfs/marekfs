### Marek Siekierski

I'm a 28 year-old software engineer living near Toronto. I'm currently employed with IBM in Watson IoT Continuous Engineering, and have been working with the Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management tools for almost 8 years.

I love music, and have been working on some metal projects for a while now. Hopefully I will have something decent to share with the world soon.
